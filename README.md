<strong>Hello world</strong> :hear_no_evil: 



[Click here to view the ToThink or ToDo project.](https://alashtal.github.io/Just-Do-it_App_or_ToThink_Ballzz/)


<strong>Welcome to Think or Just-do-it app. </strong> 
This repo contains an application helps people write down tasks, filter them
based on them being done or not OR helps them to find things to add to their to-do list, meaning gives them time to think in hypnotizing jumping balls.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
 
## UX (User Experience) :book:
 This website is desigened to be responsive on a range of devices which is smooth to navigate for potential users seeking a to-do app or fun way for spacing out and it showcases the developers skill in javascript, the main focus for the website’s owner is to present his app for other people to help them write down tasks and manifest their ideas digitally.
 Potential website visitors can simply add their tasks or space-out a little bit in a fun GUI.

- ### User stories

  - A user can add tasks to the app.
  - A user can filter the task to see which one are open, done or both.
  - To be able to effortlessly navigate the website to find the right web application.
  - To be able to find information about the app, through the modal.
  - To be able to zone-out or to gaze at the (hypnotizing) balls.

- ### Design :speak_no_evil:

  - #### Image:

    - The image I found on (pixabay) represents what I tried to create digitally.
      It's well taken, with a clean mess around.

  - #### Color:

    - The color used are colormap linear gradient of the color schemes purple, pink and blue and at most of the design purple is the color progression dominant.
      I choose the color purple because it's often assosiated with wisdom, creativity and magic. And it's my favirote color.
    - Color inspired from [dribble](https://dribbble.com).

  - #### Typography:

    - The fonts used within the website are Bootstrap standard font. Sans Serif font is used a well as a fallback font if the browser is not compatible with the fonts.

## Features

### Features Left to Implement

- #### More Interactive To-Do:

  - I'll apply more JS functions that a user can Interact with, such as a pop-up to set timer for tasks.

- #### Hosting the project in a domain:

  - I will find a hosting platform, obtain a domain as well to make the project official, and most importantly to have a bigger playground to play with and add more functionality.

- #### Adding more functionality for the balls:

  - I will add functions to make the balls more fun to play with creating more balls by each click.

- #### Notfications of tasks + changing the API:
  - Notfications of tasks about to end, plus I'll use the Google Task api and I think I can add more features.

### Existing Features

  - When Clicking on the logo, it takes you back home.

- #### Fun jumping balls.

  - The very fun jumping balls that can mesmerize users to think of a task.

- #### Modals pop when clicking on the button.

  - When clicking on the main two buttons a modal with description pop down and have some descriptive images of where the link will take you.

- #### Light show within the balls.

  - There's a linear color changing background, makes the balls more fun.

- #### Tasks-to-do app where you filter the tasks you did already.
  - If you are done with the tasks you can make it disappear by and only check the tasks that are left.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  1.  When entering the site I am greeted and with the simple design I see 2 buttons that makes me navigate easily.
  2.  The main points are concluded immediately within the two buttons, I have all the information I need.
  

- I want to smoothly navigate through the site to find information about the web application.

  1.  The users have two options:

      1.  Click on the ballz button to go to fun jumpy balls.
      2.  Click on the to-Do button to go to the web application.

### Fixed Bugs :ant:

- Getting null pointer exception (cannot read property " ..." of null, in many of my declared variable because I used Let instead of var.
- Getting null as well to my canvas because of its surronding with a div and not loading the JS first. [Solved from here ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10291693/cannot-read-property-getcontext-of-null-using-canvas)
- My get did not push at the begining and I had to use -f push to force it to push, still do not know why solved. [Solved from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/620253/git-push-rejected)
- Gitpod did not work and delayed my submission and I used Repl.it instead and had to copy paste the code from there which was written in a different way like the structure of the folders.
The gitpod problem was my most struggling problem, another problem with it is it has a delay from the server to respond to the code which made me change the code multiple of times until I asked around and tried the code somewhere else then I realized its from gitpod not the code.
